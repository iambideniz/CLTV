CLTV, alias for Customer Life Time Value and it's a good metric for CRM.

It's not possible to deal with every customer, so finding the similar customer patterns bringing the similar customers together and grouping them provides a better way of using the company resources effectively.

I used Online Retail 2 dataset in this project. This dataset contains the purchase values of a wholesale company's customers in UK between 2010-2011.
